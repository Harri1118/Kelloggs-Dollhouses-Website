          Since 1977, KELLOGG'S DOLLS' HOUSES had been offering our exclusive
          hand-built dollhouses by the late Master Craftsman, NED KELLOGG, whose
          work has been featured on <a href="http://www.kelloggsdollhouses.com/articles.html">TV, newspapers, magazines
            and books</a>.<br>
          <br>
          We are continuing the tradition of carrying a line of hand-built
          basic Capes, Colonials, Victorians and farmhouses starting at $85 for a
          four-room Cape Cod, all constructed of 3/8" cabinet-grade birch plywood
          and following Mr. Kellogg's styles. We will be expanding this line and
          will be adding them to our site. Over the years, Mr. Kellogg passed on
          much of his expertise and knowledge to his wife, SONIA KELLOGG, who has
          taken over the business and she is using his techniques and finishing
          materials as were taught to her by Mr. Kellogg. Since each house is
          individually hand cut, it is possible to have architectural detailing
          such as towers, gables, porches, extensions and porticos. Let us make a
          house for you tailored to your needs.
          This site is dedicated to NED KELLOGG and you may visit the <a
            href="http://www.kelloggsdollhouses.com/archive.html">Archives</a>
          to view some of his work. His remaining museum-quality houses can also
          be viewed in our retail shop in Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, New
          York.<br>
          <br>
          The pricing list reflects the prices for our basic hand-built
          houses in an unfinished, but totally built state and there are numerous
          possibilities which we can offer you. <img class="left_image" alt="rochest.jpg"
