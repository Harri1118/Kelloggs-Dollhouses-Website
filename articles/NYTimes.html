        </FONT>"Almost every doll house imaginable is crafted at this store and 
        private workshop, from a folk-Gothic Victorian manse to a Colonial with 
        porches. Sonia and Ned Kellogg are the store's owners in this town, which 
        is a stone's throw from Lloyd Neck; Mr. Kellogg meticulously builds the 
        miniature houses, as the Kelloggs prefer to call them. Customers may choose 
        from the basic styles Mr. Kellogg makes or take in a picture of a house 
        they would like to have built. &quot;</P>
      <P>"The houses, many of which are displayed in the store, are bought for 
        children as well as adults. Prices start at $58. (Replicas cost much more.) 
        'If you have a certain price range for your kids, don't bring them in,' 
        Mrs. Kellogg advised. 'They always want something more expensive'. But, 
        she added, they always like what they get, even if it isn't Tara.&quot; 
      </P>
      <P>"Visitors are encouraged to browse. Besides the incredibility ornate 
        and detailed houses on view (one kitchen in a Colonial was very au courant, 
        with a retro farm sink, Laura Ashley-style wallpaper and black and white 
        floor tile), there are shelves of miniature furniture and objects no house 
        could be without:tiny toothpaste tubes, toothbrushes, bunk beds, birthday 
        cakes and claw-footed tubs." </P>
