    Want a little place to call your own?<br />
    Ned Kellogg builds fine dollhouses<br />
   </div>
   <br />
   <strong>by Ruth Bashinsky</strong><br />
   <br />
   Ned Kellogg owns quite a bit of property - San Francisco townhouses, 17th Century Dutch colonials, Tudors and gothic Victorians.<br />
   <br />
   So if you're in the market for a new house - a dollhouse, that is - then master builder Kellogg would be happy to sell you any one of his dream homes.<br />
   <br />
   In a charming shop in Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., Kellogg sits quietly at his dusty workbench concealed by row after row of handmade miniatures. Kellogg and his wife spilt the duties here: He creates fantasy homes, and she runs
the store - and keeps him sane.<br />
   <br />
   &quot;Making the houses is very high-stress, but I have the nature to take it,&quot; explains Kellogg while adding some finishing touches on an ivory plantation house, his latest creation. &quot;It was never a hobby. I could
just make things.&quot;<br />
   <br />
   Kellogg, who opened Kellogg's Dollhouses with his wife 21 years ago, says he started his business because he was disgusted by the quality of commercial dollhouses.<br />
   <br />
   &quot;There was no substance,&quot; he says. &quot;So I decided if I was going to make something, it was going to be good, so we can give people their dollar's worth and more.&quot;<br />
   <br />
   While most of his ideas come from his imagination and architectural books, he's sure he can build just about anything. He remembers his most unusual request: It was from a woman who wanted a replica of the apartment building on E. 85th St. where she grew up.<br />
   <br />
   When he was finished, the structure was 7 feet high and 6 feet deep. There were 65 rooms. 12 bathrooms, sidewalks, wrought-iron handrails, fire escapes, basement stores and big plate-glass windows. It was so gigantic that it had to be delivered by a moving company.<br />
   <br />
   Scratching his salt-and-pepper beard, Kellogg says, &quot;I don't know how I did that. I wouldn't want to do that job again!&quot;<br />
   <br />
   But he seems to thrive on challenges. So far, he has spent 175 hours on a house called The Rochester, which has 18 rooms and nine doors. He estimates he'll need another 300 hours to finish it.<br />
   <br />
   The pace at which Kellogg works doesn't make for much spare time; he lives by the rule that you finish what you start. Although he's unsure where his
craft is taking him, he hopes either to find a buyer for his collection so it can be in a museum setting, or to open his own collection with the
help of an investor.<br />
   <br />
   In the meantime, Kellogg has more than two dozen orders to fill before the holidays. But he's not fazed by the workload. &quot;I don't want to stop making houses, because I like architecture,&quot; he says, &quot;and if a house is done well, I can't think of anything else I would rather do. And if I had nothing to do, I would go crazy.&quot;<br />
