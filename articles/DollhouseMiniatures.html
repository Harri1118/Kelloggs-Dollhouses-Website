Ned Kellogg turns favorite <BR>
photos into treasured keepsakes</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">by Rebecca Rhodes</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">From trendy San Francisco Victorians to elaborate
New York City brownstones, Ned Kellogg begins his remarkable miniature replicas
of real houses with one simple request: send photographs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Three to be exact, showing the front and two sides.
If the customer wants the back of the piece finished, Kellogg, of Cold Spring
Harbor, New York, asks for a fourth photo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ideally, Ned likes to inspect the actual house
to get a feel for it before beginning. Copies of schematics, architectural
plans, and dimensions are also useful in getting the proper look; but the
reality is that Ned often works solely from photos.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The cost and the technical difficulty of the project
increase with the amount of detail the customer requests. &quot;If the customer
wants a house that just looks like their house, and they don't care if it
is exact, it's a whole lot easier and cheaper to make,&quot; he explains.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;When somebody orders a Colonial or a Tudor,
I do everything on the house that is on a Colonial or Tudor. Now, if somebody
came in and said they wanted a Colonial, but it was an [exact] copy of their
house, it would be a completely different thing because there are a lot
of other details and architectural nuances I would have to get into.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Some people have shown me some pretty complicated
houses that they want perfectly duplicated inside and out, and I usually
decide it's too much [work].&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But not often. His workload is tremendous and his
output prodigious - Ned creates 150 to 200 dollhouses a year, including
commissions and additions to his private collection.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All this from a man who admits that dollhouses
were never a hobby for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A professional singer with a doctorate in basic
sciences (anatomy and physiology), Ned's first love was the stage. &quot;I
made a living at singing,&quot; he says, &quot;but the classical music situation
was getting slower and slower, so I decided that we should have a supplemental
income.&quot; To augment his performance salary, Ned and his wife, Sonia,
opened a toy store. Dollhouse kits were part of the store's merchandise
mix, but after seeing his customers' interest in them and what the kits
contained, Ned decided to try his hand at creating his own structures. &quot;Frankly,
I didn't like the quality of the commercial dollhouses,&quot; he explains.
&quot;There was no substance. So, one day I decided to start making houses.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">That was 22 years ago. The first project was to
make a large red Colonial for his daughter, a job that hooked him on miniature
architectural reproductions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;I love old, empty buildings,&quot; Ned says.
&quot;That's where most of my interest in reproductions comes from.&quot;
Besides exploring old buildings for inspiration, he scans architectural
books for other ideas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Many of his reproductions are conventional Colonials,
Tudors, or houses with mansard roofs; but he's also made a miniature lighthouse,
a windmill and a dove cote, a church, and a highly detailed 65-room brownstone
apartment building (the original was located on East 83rd Street in Manhattan).
The seven foot-high by six foot-deep brownstone contains seven flights of
stairs, 90 windows, several fire escapes, slate steps with wrought-iron
railings, a roof entrance, basement stores, plate glass windows, and sidewalks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;I don't really even know how I did it,&quot;
recalls Ned. &quot;It was huge. I had to have a moving company move it.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Quality and product integrity are important to
Ned, and that attitude is reflected in his work. &quot;The houses [I made]
in the beginning are embarassing,&quot; he admits. &quot;I worked it out
and worked it out and kept at it until I developed [a style and a standard]
because I believe in giving the customers the best for their money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;People think making dollhouses is simple,&quot;
Ned adds. &quot;It's not. The work is unbelievable. If you're going to do
it right, it's very complicated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;There are dozens and dozens of steps that
have to be done right. If you complete a stage that later is going to have
to fit in with some other stage, they all must be perfect or the entire
piece won't work.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">When replacing a full-size building in miniature,
Ned strives to use authentic materials. Most basic structures are crafted
from mahogany and pine. The frame is covered with the same materials as
the original. For some roofs, Ned assembles hundreds of hand-made shingles,
while others he covers with tar paper and sealer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">He tries to carry that authenticity through to
the building's exterior. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Stone houses are covered with genuine stones and
mortar. Wood paneling is made from separate boards, which are glued to the
structure. If the siding on a full-size house was attached with nails, Ned
uses nails to attach the miniature siding. Brick houses and chimneys are
made from either clay bricks or small pieces of real bricks. Windows are
plate glass, and fire escapes and railings are fashioned from miniature
wrought iron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Using original finished such as sandstone, brownstone,
and concrete can pose complex problems, so Ned uses imitation materials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;When using actual slabs of sandstone, you
have to get it 1/16 inch thick,&quot; says Ned. &quot;But, there's so many
different ways to create that type of finish. There's new stuff on the market
- a spray - that looks like concrete. I've been wanting to use it to create
a concrete townhouse. Then there's sandstone spray. Or you can use stucco.
You put it on with a palette, paint it, and score it so it looks like sandstone.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">After more than two decades and thousands of houses,
Ned is unsure of where his work will take him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;I don't want to stop making houses because
I like architecture, and I like to keep busy,&quot; says Ned. &quot;Besides,
I can't stand not getting things finished. If I take a day off, it really
bothers me. I'm in the workshop six, sometimes seven nights a week.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Eventually he hopes to either find a buyer for
his collection so it can be exhibited in a museum setting, or he would like
to create a site to display his collection.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The interest his houses generate amazes Ned, who
has found a great deal of personal satisfaction in his work. &quot;I've
accomplished all I've wanted to from life,&quot; he says. &quot;All I want
now is peace, lots of money, and a canoe.&quot; And, of course, the time
to use it.</FONT></P>
