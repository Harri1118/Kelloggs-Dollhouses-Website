  <b>Who are we?</b> Kellogg's Doll Houses, located in the historic whaling town of
  Cold Spring Harbor on the Long Island Sound, was founded by the late Ned Kellogg
  in 1977 who was a master crasftsmen and whose work has been featured on TV, 
  newspapers, books, and magazines. Mr. Kellogg passed away in 2008 and he was known 
  for his outstanding museum-quality dollhouses and replicas as well as for his 
  popular-priced houses from a Cape to a Victorian to a Tudor.
  <br>
  <br>
  This website is dedicated to the late Ned Kellogg and some of his works can be
  seen in the <a href="archives.html" target="#blank">archive</a> section of this site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ned taught much of his techniques, knowledge and expertise to his wife, Sonia Kellogg, who has continued his legacy offering her 
  own exclusive designs as well as designs based on Mr. Kellogg's houses. Our houses are constructed of 3/8" birch plywood starting at 
  $115 for a four-room Cape Cod with Colonials starting at $220 and each house is individually hand made for the customer and can be 
  customized as per the customer's tastes and price point.  We also specialize in restoring older dollhouses, some photos of which can be 
  seen on the Facebook Page and can be sent to you upon request.  We also take commissions for replicating an existing structure, samples 
  of commissioned replicas can be seen on this site in the <a href="gallery.html" target="#blank">Gallery</a> or on Kellogg's 
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kelloggsdollhouses" target="#blank" >Kellogg's Facebook page.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  Should the customer want a house built but in an unfinished stage, or semi-finished stage, we will give free tutorials and
  take you through the finishing process and will sell you the materials necessary to do the finishing. Our dollhouses
  customers are entitled to double discounts on all materials and furniture and accessories which we sell. Other
  customers also receive discounts as well. We sell all the major brands.
  <br>
  <br>
  We look foward to making your Dollhouse Wishes come true.
